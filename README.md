# exo-outgassing
An outgassing model for exoplanet scientists to calculate outgassing rates and atmospheric compositions from deep water cycling and carbonate silicate cycling in an active plate tectonic regime. You can vary its oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance to obtain potential outgassing rates for various geological evolution pathways.
